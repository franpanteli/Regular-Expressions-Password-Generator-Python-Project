# Regular-Expressions-Password-Generator-Project
### About This Repository
I independently completed freeCodeCampâ€™s [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification, to invest in my scientific computing skills with Python. This repository contains my independent problem-solving work, as part of the fifth project in this curriculum. I devised a script for this [password-generator.py](https://github.com/franpanteli/Regular-Expressions-Password-Generator-Python-Project/blob/main/password-generator.py), which applied regular expressions in Python, to produce a random password generator program, This program may be run by cloning this repository, and was designed to generate random passwords with an inputted number of characters and constraints. The project .py file includes in-depth problem solving approaches used to write this program and my project [regular expressions problem solving thought process notes](https://github.com/franpanteli/Regular-Expressions-Password-Generator-Python-Project/blob/main/Regular%20Expressions%20Problem%20Solving%20Thought%20Process%20Notes.txt) contain more information regarding its theory. This enabled me to invest in my regular expression skills with Python and marked the successful completion of the fifth project in the certification.
